# TradingWithCode
Welcome! This is a set of homemade Python tools & web-based tools I made to collect & analyze stock market data and design/test trading strategies. \
DISCLAIMER: I do not guarantee that any of this stuff functions correctly or provides accurate information.

## Python Version
I've been using Python3.11 to work on this project. 

## Setting Up the Repo and Virtual Environment
First, clone the repo.
```
git clone git@github.com:kelvinchengGH/TradingWithCode.git
```
Next, move into the repo directory and run the configure script to set up the Python virtual environment and install the necessary Python modules within the virtual environment.
```
./configure.sh
```

## Entering the Virtual Environment
Whenever you work with this code, the first thing you should always do is activate the Python virtual enviroment and make sure the appropriate directories are included in your PYTHONPATH. This can be done by running the command below inside the repo's root directory.
```
source start-venv.sh
```
