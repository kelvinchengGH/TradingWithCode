# TradingWithCode
This is a set of homemade Python tools & web-based tools I made to collect & analyze stock market data and design/test trading strategies.

## Python Version
I've been using Python3.11 to work on this project. 

## Setting Up
First, clone the repo.
```
git clone git@github.com:kelvinchengGH/TradingWithCode.git
```
Next, move into the repo directory and run the configure script to set up the Python virtual environment and install the necessary Python modules.
```
./configure.sh
```
